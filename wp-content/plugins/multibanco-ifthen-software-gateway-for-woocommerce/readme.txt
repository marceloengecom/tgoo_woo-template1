Secure WooCommerce payments with Multibanco, MB WAY, Credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Payshop, Cofidis, and PIX via ifthenpay’s payment gateway.

== Description ==

“Pagamento de Serviços” (payment of services) on Multibanco (Portuguese ATM network), and MB WAY (using the customer’s mobile phone number), are the most popular ways to pay for services and (online) purchases in Portugal.
Portuguese consumers trust the “Multibanco” and “MB WAY” payment methods more than any other.

This plugin generates a “Multibanco” Payment Reference that customers can use to pay for their WooCommerce orders at an ATM or via home banking, or an “MB WAY” payment request which will send a push notification to the customer’s mobile phone for payment approval.

Credit or debit cards, including Apple Pay and Google Pay, CTT Payshop, and Cofidis Pay payment methods are also available.

Holders of a Brazilian bank account can conveniently pay for WooCommerce orders in Euros, with automatic currency conversion to Brazilian Real, using PIX.

This is the official [ifthenpay](https://ifthenpay.com) plugin, and a contract with this company is required. Technical support is provided by [Naked Cat Plugins](https://nakedcatplugins.com) (by [Webdados](https://www.webdados.pt)) on the [WordPress.org support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/multibanco-ifthen-software-gateway-for-woocommerce/).

* MB WAY: Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Checkout > Pagamento MB WAY no telemóvel and fill in the data provided by ifthenpay: MB WAY Key.
* Credit or debit card: Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Checkout > Credit or debit card and fill in the data provided by ifthenpay: Credit card Key.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I start receiving payments right away? Show me the money! =

You have to sign a contract with ifthenpay to activate this service. Go to [ifthenpay.com](https://ifthenpay.com/?lang=en) for more information and to sign up.

= I’m an individual and not a registered business. Can I use this plugin? =

ifthenpay only provides this service to registered businesses and equivalents (such as tax-registered freelancers).
You should [contact ifthenpay](https://ifthenpay.com/#contactos) if you need additional details on this matter.

= The generated Multibanco reference does not contain the order number. How do I know which order was paid? =

ifthenpay will send you an email each time a reference is paid, but the reference does not contain the order number. By design, our plugin does not include the order number in the reference because of the way WooCommerce/WordPress sets orders/posts IDs.
Anyway, you do not need the order number in the reference, because our plugin uses a callback mechanism. ifthenpay automatically notifies WooCommerce when a specific Multibanco reference is used for payment. The order is linked to the reference in the database and will also be automatically set as paid.
If you still need to know which order a reference is linked to, use the search box on the WooCommerce Orders administration screen.

= How do I test the callback call to simulate a payment and foresee what happens when a real payment is made by a customer? =

Edit your wp-config.php file and set `WP_DEBUG` to `true`.
Then, place a test order in the frontend using any of the plugin’s payment methods.
Go to the order edit screen and click the “Simulate callback payment” button.
Don’t forget to set `WP_DEBUG` to `false` again, as it should not be active on a production website.

= How to issue an MB WAY or Credit or debit card refund within WooCommerce? =

Just like in any other WooCommerce payment gateway that supports refunds.
Check out the instructions carefully [here (Automatic refunds, step 4)](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-refunds/) and [here (WooCommerce specific instructions)](https://helpdesk.ifthenpay.com/pt-PT/support/solutions/articles/79000130517-devoluc%C3%B5es-de-pagamentos-aos-ordenantes).

= Can I use this plugin and the ifthenpay service on more than one website? =

Yes, but not with the same payment method keys.
Ask ifthenpay for different credentials for each website, and payment method, you need the service to be available.
There are no extra costs, and you can even route payments to separate bank accounts.

= Can I change the look and feel of the payment instructions on the “Thank you” page and/or the new order email, as well as the SMS message format? =

Yes, you can, but you should know your way around WordPress filters.
There are filters for this, and you can find examples in `hooks-examples.php`.

= Can I change the payment gateway icon on the checkout page? =

There are also filters for this. See `hooks-examples.php`.

= I want to charge an additional fee for these payment methods. How should I do it? =

You shouldn’t! To our knowledge, it’s illegal under [Portuguese law](https://www.bportugal.pt/sites/default/files/anexos/legislacoes/dl3ano2010.PDF) and a [European directive](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/finance-funding/making-receiving-payments/electronic-cash-payments/index_en.htm) to charge an extra fee based on the payment method chosen by the customer.
If you don’t care about legislation, plugins are available that allow you to set extra fees per payment method. Please, don’t ask us for support on this.

= How much time does the customer have to pay with MB WAY? =

The MB WAY payment requests expire after 4 minutes.

= Why doesn’t the customer receive an email when paying with MB WAY, Credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or PIX? =

These payments need to be approved immediately after checking out.
WooCommerce only sends payment instruction emails for payment methods that require later payment, not immediate payment, like Multibanco, Payshop, and Bank transfer, for example.
The customer will still receive an email upon payment if properly configured in WooCommerce (just not before).

= Do Apple Pay and Google Pay support Express Checkout? =

Not at this time. Apple Pay and Google Pay are processed via the ifthenpay Gateway. Everything related to payment happens there, and the customer is redirected back to the website afterward.
This means the checkout addresses are the ones the user entered on the website checkout page, not the ones provided by Apple or Google, which also means any custom field will be collected, which doesn’t happen on Express Checkout.

= [WPML] My website is multilingual. Will I be able to use this plugin? =

Yes. This plugin is officially WPML compatible.
You will need the WPML and WPML String Translation Plugins (alongside WooCommerce Multilingual, which is mandatory for any WooCommerce + WPML install). 

= [WPML] How can I translate the payment method title and description the customer sees on the checkout page to secondary languages? =

Go to WPML > String Translation > Search and translate all the strings in the `woocommerce` and `multibanco_ifthen_for_woocommerce` domains containing `ifthen_for_woocommerce` in their name.

= [SMS] How to include the Multibanco and/or Payshop payment instructions in the SMS sent by “WooCommerce - APG SMS Notifications”? =

Go to WooCommerce > SMS Notifications and add the `%multibanco_ifthen%` and/or `%payshop_ifthen%` variables to “Order on-hold custom message”.

= [SMS] How to include the Multibanco and/or Payshop payment instructions in the SMS sent by “Twilio SMS Notifications”? =

Go to WooCommerce > Settings > SMS and add the `%multibanco_ifthen%` and/or `%payshop_ifthen%` variables to “Customer Notifications“ > “On Hold SMS Message”.

= [SMS] How to include the Multibanco and/or Payshop payment instructions in the SMS sent by “YITH WooCommerce SMS Notification”? =

Go to YITH Plugins > SMS Notifications > SMS Settings and add the `{multibanco_ifthen}` and/or `{payshop_ifthen}` variables to “On hold”.

= [Advanced] Can I use a specific Multibanco Entity/Subentity or Key, MB WAY, Credit card, or Payshop Key based on order details? =

Yes, you should use the `multibanco_ifthen_base_ent_subent` or `multibanco_ifthen_base_mbkey`, `multibanco_ifthen_base_mbwaykey`, `multibanco_ifthen_base_creditcardkey` or `multibanco_ifthen_base_payshopkey` filters. See `hooks-examples.php`.

= [Advanced] The order is set to “On Hold” for Multibanco and Payshop, can I make it “Pending” by default? =

You shouldn’t but… yes, you can. Just return `false` to the `multibanco_ifthen_set_on_hold` and/or `payshop_ifthen_set_on_hold` filter.
Be advised that no “new order” email, with payment instructions, will be sent to the customer unless you use some plugin or custom code to force it.

= [Advanced] I’ve set up WooCommerce to cancel unpaid orders after x minutes, why are my Multibanco and/or Payshop orders not being canceled? =

WooCommerce only automatically cancels “Pending” orders, not “On Hold”, because these orders are set to be paid by offline methods (like Multibanco or Payshop), and payment can occur at any time, even after the order is canceled. Still, if you want to take that risk, just return `true` to the `multibanco_ifthen_cancel_unpaid_orders` and/or `payshop_ifthen_cancel_unpaid_orders` filter.
You can also restore that order’s product stock by returning `true` to the `multibanco_ifthen_cancel_unpaid_orders_restore_stock` and/or `payshop_ifthen_cancel_unpaid_orders_restore_stock` filter, although the WooCommerce team [doesn’t recommend](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/3712#issuecomment-23650563) it.
Be advised the Multibanco or Payshop reference will still be active and can be paid later on.

= [Advanced] Can I prevent the plugin from adding the payment instructions and/or the payment received message to emails? =

You can use the `multibanco_ifthen_email_instructions_pending_send` and/or `mbway_ifthen_email_instructions_pending_send` filter: return false and the payment instructions won’t be included in the “new order” email – we do not recommend you to do it, though.
You can use the `multibanco_ifthen_email_instructions_payment_received_send` and/or `mbway_ifthen_email_instructions_payment_received_send` filter: return false and the payment received message won’t be included in the “Processing” or “Completed” email.

= ifthenpay says my callback URL is returning a 404 error. Is there a solution? =

You probably have weird permalink settings (or permalinks not set at all) in your WordPress install.

If your permalinks are set as “Plain”, tell them to change the callback URL from `https://yourwebsite/wc-api/WC_Multibanco_IfThen_Webdados/?chave=[CHAVE_ANTI_PHISHING]...` to `https://yourwebsite/?wc-api=WC_Multibanco_IfThen_Webdados&chave=[CHAVE_ANTI_PHISHING]...`.
If your permalinks are set as “Custom structure”: `/index.php/%postname%/` tell them to set the callback to `https://yourwebsite/index.php/wc-api/WC_Multibanco_IfThen_Webdados/?chave=[CHAVE_ANTI_PHISHING]...`

= Is this plugin compliant with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? =

This plugin does not collect or send any private data of the website where it’s installed, its customers, or the orders, to Webdados (the plugin author) or ifthenpay (the payment processor).
In the MB WAY module, the mobile phone number is collected to request payment authorization and it can be legitimately processed based on Article 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR.
ifthenpay’s privacy policy can be found at [https://ifthenpay.com/termosCondicoes](https://ifthenpay.com/termosCondicoes)

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage? =

Yes. This plugin is fully compatible with HPOS since December 2022.

= Is this plugin compatible with the WooCommerce Cart and Checkout Blocks? =

Yes. This plugin is compatible with the Block-Based Checkout since August 2020.

= I need technical support. Who should I contact, ifthenpay or Webdados? =
